drupalcon 2012
webchick

update on the past year:
  wins:
    git migration, subscribe button, api change notices
    wisywig editing, image uploading
    issue summaries
    docs team, make it obvious that you (yes you) should edit
    distribution tools on d.o, now have lots distributions
    api.d.o has oo support, hook-awareness, theme-awareness
      views is hosted on a.d.o
    drupal.org dev sandbox (hack on a personal version of d.o)
  plan for this year:
    "I have no idea of what I'm doing."
    initiatives: improve d.o for site builders and developers (and sponsors too)
    What does it mean?
      idk
      lots ov interviews, conversations with hackers and infrastructure folks, community voting
  common trends:
    there are critical things that we clearly need to do, but the initiative's stalled out.
    community-driven initiatives aren't getting consitent attention, resulting in gnarly burnout
      "we're a community of developers who can't change out effing website."
    d.o's bus factor was really bad.  nobody understood the whole thing
      some of them felt passionate, but some are sticking around out of oblication
    d.o *needs* to be on d7, and the da needs to lead it.
      "your own effing website doesn't use drupal 7"
  the plan for htenext 3 months:
    build a full-time d.o team on:
      big scary stuff that only ythe da can do
        d7 upgrade, project ratings
      high-impact low-hanging fruit
        bluecheese on g.d.o
      reviewing/deplying community-driven initiatives
        make a.d.o better, case studies section
  needed: Write Everything Down
  need to grow the team by 2013
    e.g. devops, ux lead
    in addition to current people

goals:
  (sb = site builder, d = devlopers, s  =sponsors)

  big goals (q2, q3)
    project ratings/reviews (for site builders)
      how do you know which module to use?  without this, you have to just know.
    port d.o to d7 (d)
      want to use everyday modern drupal tools on d.o,
      make contributing to drupal via d.o eaiser

  small things (weekly)
    better case studies (sb)
    improved events listing on d.o (sb)
    backlink commits in issues (d)
    "follow" ux improvements (d)
      who's following this issue?
    better hosting page (s)
    better marketplace (s)
    better job board (s)

  community things (mid-sized project, people want but it's not on fire)
    curated docs (sb)
    better support section (sb)
    a.d.o improvements (d)
    better case studies (s)
    better books listing (s)
    project application process automation (d)

  certain parts of d.o will be monetized
    e.g. featured distributions, sponsored job listings
    this doesn't mean weight-loss ads in the issue queue
    drupal 

timeline:
  q1: bootstrap team, quick wins, set up community process
  q2: d.o/d7 sprint, med-term wins, incorporate community improvements
  q3: complete d.o/d7, project ratings/reviews, rework community priorities, comm. improvements
