alice in wonderland of fields and entities
karen stevenson

will talk abtou lots of modules, not all are safe for production use
best analog to entities is alice in wonderland

in te beginning, the Story module.
needed to write code if you watned to have other fields (recommended path: copy/paste code, rename, etc)
next, flexinode, which took off way beyond expectation
in 4.7, enter CCK with custom content ttypes and fields, all through an nice ui (well, not nice)
when you have a hammer... (becasue everything could be a node and nodes were flexible)
around 5, 6 custom content types went into core.  

everything isn't actually a noce, but everything needs fields (users, comments, etc)
in 7, cck is now in core and we only need the entity api (have fields in core, custom contet types, entities)


SKIP, go to views talk
views for developers
bevan rudge

custom code sucks.  you have to maintain it, upgrade, it'll be buggy for a while, etc
"before you extend, can you bend?"
the more config you know, the lesscode you need

anayomy ofa view: (note to reader: find diagram if possible)
top level: title, display (display: header area: area plugin) exposed filters, attachments (before)
rows (row: entity OR field, field, ...) OR empty area (empty area: area plugin)
pager, attachments (after) (footer area: area plugin), feed icons

view3 lets you configure the eleemnt that wraps the field (v2 + semantic views)
also does "provide default field wrapper elements" under style options

other feature: field concatenation
  "rewrite the output of this field"
feature: render field as link

and/or filters: new in views3, same as views OR but nicer
  it's not in the ui, but you can OR together contextual filters
  (the filters end up in the WHERE clause)

result summaries/oager summaries
  "displaying 1-7 of 7"
  area plugin

aggregate/count queries
  prepreq is to be able to debug the sql, because it's complicated
  also v. powerful
  enable "use aggregation" -> "aggregation settings", "COUNT(...)"

alternate pagers: date, alphabetical, glossary
  page: pager option does this
  ussually use a contextual filter

views link area (views_linkarea contrib module)
  exposes area plugin to add a link

review: look for simple solutions, don't write custom code
anayomy of a view, custom markup for fields, field concat, fields as custom links, no results behavior for fields and summary views.
and/or config for filters, contextual filters, results ummaries, agg/count queries, date/etc-based pagers, link are module

part 2: add new and custom feature:
