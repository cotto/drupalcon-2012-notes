alice in wonderland of fields and entities
karen stevenson

will talk abtou lots of modules, not all are safe for production use
best analog to entities is alice in wonderland

in te beginning, the Story module.
needed to write code if you watned to have other fields (recommended path: copy/paste code, rename, etc)
next, flexinode, which took off way beyond expectation
in 4.7, enter CCK with custom content ttypes and fields, all through an nice ui (well, not nice)
when you have a hammer... (becasue everything could be a node and nodes were flexible)
around 5, 6 custom content types went into core.  

everything isn't actually a noce, but everything needs fields (users, comments, etc)
in 7, cck is now in core and we only need the entity api (have fields in core, custom contet types, entities)


SKIP, go to views talk
views for developers
bevan rudge

custom code sucks.  you have to maintain it, upgrade, it'll be buggy for a while, etc
"before you extend, can you bend?"
the more config you know, the lesscode you need

anayomy ofa view:
top level: title, display (display: header area: area plugin) exposed filters, attachments (before)
rows (row: entity OR field, field, ...) OR empty area (empty area: area plugin)
pager, attachments (after) (footer area: area plugin), feed icons

view3 lets you configure the eleemnt that wraps the field (v2 + semantic views)
also does "provide default field wrapper elements" under style options
