drupalize your data with entities
drupalcon 2012

speaker; wolfgang ziegler aka fago (entity api maintainer)

big shift in d7- fields everywhere, thanks to entites
other concept ius bundles - 
  analogous to content types
  taxonomy terms and vocabularies
  users have no bundles

lots of modules expose entites: commerce, og, profile2, file entity, heartbeat/message

lots of moudles expose stuff that modifies existing modules

entity api:
  unified access to any data in drupal (e.g. search, vote, entity ref, rules all work on entities)

entity intercation:
  entity api is your friend
  core defines entities, entity api extends them
  metadata wrapper: lets you mess with metadata without caring about how it's stored
    smart get/set with a bit of magic
    label = human-readable value (?)
    metadata wrapper also includes access
  property info:
    unified acccess to entity data, plus validation and access control
    validation examples:
      commerce, vbo and og (simplest, via entity metadata wrapper)
      rules, search api (rely on entity property information)
      microdata (annotates metadata based on property data)
      restws, wsclient (based just on entity type)
      entity tokens (ensures there's a token)
      entity views (???)

providing an entity type:
  hook_entity_info()
  specify controller class
  implement hook_schema()
  
  use entity_create('type', ...) before save, etc

integrating entity types
  most of the work happens in the entity api code
    info + crud conttroller + schema, field api, property info
    views, rules and tokens sit on top of this
  entities can be made exportable
    
profile2: good example, uses lots of features of entities
  has own entity tpe, bundles
  supports CRUD, field api, admin ui, views/features/tokesn etc
  access, permissions, display and the profile form are the responsibility of the site admin
  
entities don't have to be db-based
  nosql, doctrine, phpcr or remote entities, integrate random data
  fields go into the db by default, so integrating them into a non-sql storage is tricky
    be non-fieldable, use only properties
  can enable entity cache module, cache entities in memcache ( http://drupal.org/project/entitycache )
  can use search api to index remote entities (just have to deal with staleness)
  example: google picasa entities - drupal.org/sandbox/fago/1493180
  
needs work:
  there's no read-only mode
  generate display, generated form
  

drupal 8:
  entity api is in core
  full crud controller in core (currently in comments, soon to be in the others)
  will need to use entity_create('type', ...) because stdclass won't work
    this'll also mean that you can do ->save(), ->delete(), etc
  class Comment extends Entity { ... }
